      <ul>
        <li>a blood glucose metre</li>
        <li>small needles called lancets</li>
        <li>a plastic pen to hold the lancest</li>
        <li>small test strips</li>
      </ul>

    <nhs-expander text="When to check your blood glucose level">
      <p>Try to check your blood:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>before meals</li>
        <li>2 to 3 hours after meals</li>
        <li>before, during (take a break) and after exercise</li>
